# lilac

**lilac** is a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) Mod Loader and modding SDK with a modern approach towards mod development. Unlike previous mod loaders, which merely inject the DLLs and let them handle the rest, lilac aims to be a more comprehensive project, which manages loaded mods & hooks itself. lilac utilizes a trap hooking technique for hooks to ensure performance, compatability, portability and ease of use. For modders, lilac means easy development and (hopefully) portability; for end users, lilac means an uniform and easy experience using mods.
